    <p><strong>My role:</strong> Develop independently</p>
    <p>
    Convolutional Neural Network has been sucessfully applied to image classification, object detection, etc. However, It's not easy to apply it to duplicate search or object retrieval due to the difficult of data enhancement. Duplicate search can be used to many business applications such as searching the same clothes or shoes on Taobao, and I believe it has great application vulae. So after diving into image retrieval based on key point feature such as SIFT, I implement a prototype system based on bag of feature. The performance of the prototype image retrieval system works very well, and the mAP can be achieve to 83.35%. Moreover. I test it on 1500,000 clothes images, and the search result can be found <a href="https://github.com/willard-yuan/pkbigdata-image-search">here</a>.

	<p><strong>My role:</strong> Develop independently</p>
	<p>After researching CBIR one year, I determined to develop a image retrieval engine demo just 
    for interest. The convolutional neural networks in the comuter vision community develop so
    fast in recent  years and show great performance with various tasks. So in my spare time I
    dive to read papers of CNN and program. The dataset of PicSearch engine is Caltech256, which 
    contains 29780 images, and until now it supports query in the dataset only.

    <h2>HABIR</h2>
    <h3>Project: <a href="http://yongyuan.name/habir">Hashing Baseline for Image Retrieval</a></h3>
    <p><strong>My role:</strong> Develop independently with open sources</p>
	<p>I do the image retrieval research in early 2013. My mission is to design
    efficient hashing algorithm to map the semantic similar images to the similar codes.
    There are two main advantages using hashing method for image retrieval, i.e. storage and
    computation efficience. To let more researchers focus on design hashing algorithm, I have 
    built a hashing baseline, hoping this project can do some help for some researchers.

    <h2>PCVwithPython</h2>
    <h3>Project: <a href="http://yongyuan.name/pcvwithpython">Programming Computer Vision with Python(Translate to Chinese)</a></h3>
    <p><strong>My role:</strong> equal contribution with one partner</p>
	<p>I'm a big fun of Python. I think Python is one of the most elegant programming language
    I have known. It's a great power tool which can be used everywhere, such as write scripts,
    using Django for web developmentand do science computation. When I first meet the book <Programming 
    Computer Vision with Python>, I was attracted by the book. The content in this book is 
    quite rich and diverse and I can't bear to share the book to more people. So in my free time, I dived into
    the book and translate it into Chinese. Morover, I organized and supply the codes.</p>
